### Plan of Attack

1. Create the basic html that will render instructions, score, highscore,
   and the grid.

2. Put one square on the board. Allow for input and move one square around.

3. Randomly put square on board on an empty square in the grid.

4. Collapse these two tiles together to make a larger tile.

5. Updates score when two tiles collapse.

6. Alerts user when they have created a 2048 (end game or continue?)

7. Recognizes when the grid is full and the user has lost.

8. Checks to see whether score is a highscore; logs accordingly.
